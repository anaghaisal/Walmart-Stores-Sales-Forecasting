# Walmart-Stores-Sales-Forecasting

For this project, we have used the dataset available from ‘Walmart Store Sales Forecasting’ project that was available on Kaggle. In this dataset, we have weekly sales data for 45 stores and 99 departments for a period of 3 years. In addition, we had store and geography specific information such as store size, unemployment rate, temperature, promotional markdowns etc. Using these factors, we needed to develop a regression model that can forecast the sales and is also computationally efficient and scalable.

In this project, we conducted multiple linear regression to predict the future sales. There were several different factors that we analyzed in our regression model starting with a full model with all the variables and then moving towards a reduced model by eliminating insignificant variables. We used several different exploratory analyses to identify the key variables for our regression equation such as correlation plots, heatmaps, histograms etc.
